    <h2>CRYSTALS AND RAIKI</h2>
    <p>Reiki is an amazingly simple but powerful form of spiritual healing practice in which the practitioner channels Reiki—universal life force energy—which is in and around every living being. This means Reiki is for everyone, because everyone has Reiki—it is a completely natural energy. Think of when a child falls and scrapes their knee: their parent places a hand on the knee for a few seconds, and the pain disappears—this is Reiki healing.</p> <br>
    <p>When crystal healing is combined with Reiki, it is like hitting the healing overdrive switch! Crystals have an innate energy of their own. They bring everything to balance and speed the body’s natural healing ability. You don’t have to do anything to get a crystal to work other than place it in your vicinity. However, if you do add your intent and your energy, your crystals will work better because they’ll pick up your intention and magnify it manyfold. And if Reiki is the energy that is flowing through you, then your crystals will collect the Reiki, multiply its effect, and focus its objective.</p>
